This app targets a very specific audience, it is important to keep track of any issues that might come up beforehand. For this reason there is this TDB section in the docs of this repo.

## data privacy
### issue
As this app will be collecting a lot of very sensitive, personal data, every effort has to be made to keep this data safe and private. 

### possible solutions
1. This can be achieved by using a encrypted database, that is only accessible by the app itself. The app should also be able to delete all data on request at any time, so the user can be sure that their data is not being used for anything else there after.
2. The app should also be able to show the user the data that is being collected and stored. This way the user can be sure that the app is not doing anything behind their back. However, this might get dropped as this could open a potential backdoor to access that data unauthorized.
3. Just don't use the cloud. All data should be stored locally on the device, the less data breaches there are, the better. ^^
