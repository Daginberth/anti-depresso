The user's mind is represented as a town, which if not provided with their needs shows the same symptoms as the user (citizens being depressed etc).
By the actions the user takes they can provide the townspeople with their needs and thus make them happy.

These "recourses" can be represented as social interactions, activity, food, sleep and working conditions. The user can provide these recourses by interacting with the app, which will then provide them with suggestions on how to proceed.
